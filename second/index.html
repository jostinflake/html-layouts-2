		<p>Illidan Stormrage, the original Demon Hunter, betrayed his people by creating a new Well of Eternity after the demonic invasion of Azeroth. After 10,000 years of imprisonment he was freed by Tyrande Whisperwind against his own brother Malfurion Stormrage's wishes. Now, Illidan lords over the realm of Outland, slaughtering unsuitably prepared heroes who venture into his domain.</p>

		<p>Betrayer... In truth, it was I who was betrayed. Still, I am hunted. Still, I am hated. Now, my blind eyes see what others cannot: that sometimes the hand of fate must be forced! Now go forth... unleash the tides of Doom... Upon all those...who would oppose us.</p>
